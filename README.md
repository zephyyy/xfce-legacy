# xfce-legacy

A repository for building a legacy branch of the Xfce Desktop Environment (4.12) on modern Gentoo Linux.

Apart from a few exceptions, contains only the ebuilds and patches necessary for building an older, gtk2-based version of Xfce.



## TODO

* xfce4-weather-plugin gtk2 patches
* More gcc14+ patches (`incompatible-pointer-types` and friends)
* perhaps a better README?
